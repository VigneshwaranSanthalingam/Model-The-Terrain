# Model-the-Terrain
Interfaced GY-87 Sensor, Color Sensor, IR Sensors, White Line Sensors with Firebird V to build a sophisticated robot that is capable of scanning an alien territory and model it in 3D in Blender 2.0  Programmed an Genetic Algorithm algorithm to control the robot remotely from the server.

Model-the-Terrain/Programming-Models has the basic code models for every sensor and every feature the sensor can perform.
